In response to these cues, specific proteins and nucleic acids engage in multivalent interactions and undergo phase separation to form membraneless assemblies known as biomolecular condensates. Nuclear condensates include paraspeckles, nuclear speckles, and Cajal bodies, while cytoplasmic condensates include stress granules, processing bodies, RNA transport granules,...",

      "description": "Lithium-sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. However, their commercialization is hindered by poor cycling performance caused by the polysulfide shuttle effect. While strategies such as physical barriers or chemical adsorption have been proposed, they inevitably introduce inactive components, reducing energy density. These limitations underscore the need for a more fundamental approach that avoids the use of...",

In the adult eye, Sox9 expression persists in several cell types, including the retinal pigmented epithelium cells and the Müller glial (MG) cells, as well as in the limbal and corneal basal epithelia. To uncover the role of Sox9 in these cell types, we induced the deletion of the gene in adult mice. We found that, after Sox9 ablation, mutant mice undergo a severe process of retinal degeneration...",
