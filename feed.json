However, a major drawback to the progress of the field relates to the fact that isolating pure EV fractions from complex biofluids is a challenging task. Isolation of EVs is often compromised by the presence of contaminating protein and lipoprotein particles, which has recently led to the establishment of guidelines for analyzing and...",
