Transmissive metasurfaces are an essential requirement in cascaded arrays of metasurfaces and enable integration with chip-scale light sources and detectors. However, most existing active phase control metasurface designs are reflective due to fundamental limitations in single-resonance transmissive architectures, which typically exhibit a...",

There are currently no vaccines or drugs available, leaving susceptible populations vulnerable to severe or protracted illness. A HuNoV cultivation system is pivotal for screening norovirus antivirals. While the human intestinal enteroid cultivation system allows robust replication of multiple HuNoV strains, it presents technical and cost barriers. Tulane virus (TV), a surrogate for...",
