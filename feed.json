An 82-year-old man was admitted with a chief complaint of slurred speech. The patient had fever and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Incidentally, two abscesses with increased density in the surrounding fatty tissue were identified using computed tomography. An emergency surgery was performed. A series of diverticula were found on the mesenteric...",
