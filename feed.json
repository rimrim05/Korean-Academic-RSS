Nevertheless, its low water solubility necessitates use of irritating solvents which hinder its clinical administration. Since these solvents usually cause adverse reactions, nanotechnology-based carriers have emerged as promising strategies for topical delivery of minoxidil. Thus, we prepared topical delivery nanocarriers,...",

      "description": "Everyday discrimination (ED) has adverse effects on health and well-being. This study highlights understudied trends in the distribution, correlates, and geographic variation of ED among Indian adults aged 45 and above. The analysis of 61,722 participants in the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (2017-18) revealed significant state/union territory (UT)-level variation. While Nagaland, Tripura, Mizoram, and Lakshadweep had comparatively lower ED scores than the national average, Jammu and...",
