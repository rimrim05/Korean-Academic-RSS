The recent convergence of DNA recombinase-mediated technology with prime editing has established a promising new frontier for large-scale genomic integration. However, this strategy has limitations, including low intrinsic catalytic efficiency of DNA recombination enzymes and inefficiency of their long DNA landing pad insertions. To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel directed evolution strategy using...",

      "description": "The effective method for eliminating the Moiré fringes in the MC nanoprecipitates in the austenite matrix was studied. Considering the dynamic diffraction between the matrix and precipitate, the spots originating from the Moiré pattern were selected in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern. The Moiré fringe image was extracted by performing inverse FFT(IFFT) of the selected spots. Subtracting the Moiré fringe contribution from the original image intensity reveals the veiled lattice fringes of...",
