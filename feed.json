      "description": "This review explores the relationships between physiological parameters and emotions, as well as the potential value and applications of the use of machine learning to facilitate emotion recognition. First, the relationships between physiological parameters (such as heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, galvanic skin response, electroencephalography, and heart rate variability [HRV]) and emotions are discussed. The impacts of emotional states on these physiological parameters represent a...",
