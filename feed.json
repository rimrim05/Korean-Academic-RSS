      "description": "Various studies have explored mechanical impedance control strategies in soft actuators to enhance stability and precision, as the nonlinear characteristics of soft materials frequently lead to unwanted oscillations. Among these approaches, electrostatic (ES) clutches have shown promise for achieving friction-based mechanical impedance control; however, conventional ES clutches are limited by issues such as residual charge accumulation and stick-slip behavior, which compromise force stability...",

While Sn metal additives are traditionally utilized to mitigate the oxidation of Sn^(2+), alternative stabilization strategies remain unexplored. In this study, an...",

Using an information-theoretic decomposition of eigenstate entropy, we demonstrate that spatial delocalization may...",

The key ingredients of our approach are optimal transport theory and an achievable Fano's inequality, by which...",
