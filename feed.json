Here we show that HSAT is ubiquitously expressed in the basement membranes of epithelial cells in multiple tissues. In the...",

      "description": "Nucleosome repositioning is essential for establishing nucleosome-depleted regions to initiate transcription. This process has been extensively studied using structural, biochemical, and single-molecule approaches, which require homogeneously positioned nucleosomes. This is often achieved using the Widom 601 sequence, a highly efficient nucleosome-positioning element (NPE) selected for its unusually strong binding to the H3-H4 histone tetramer. Due to the artificial nature of 601, native NPEs...",
