Here, the feasibility of carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel modified with pyrogallol (CMC-PG) is checked for injection laryngoplasty. CMC-PG, owing to its low viscosity, is easily injectable in liquid form and can self-polymerize into a hydrogel without the need for oxidative cross-linking agents. Moreover, the CMC-PG hydrogel demonstrates improved stability, tissue adhesiveness,...",

Cerebral amyloidosis precedes synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration markers, followed by the onset of AD-related cognitive impairment. To improve early AD-biomarker detection accuracy, patient data is, however, often collected via invasive procedures such as a lumbar puncture or...",
