      "description": "Visible-light activation is highly desirable for gas sensors due to its energy-efficient operation and broad accessibility. Photocatalysis offers a promising strategy for visible-light activation; however, a limited understanding of the band engineering-mediated activation process restricts the rational design of photocatalysts for gas sensors. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of band tuning in photocatalysts on the nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) sensing performance of...",

However, their stability remains a critical challenge, notably due to reversible photoinduced halide segregation. Under continuous illumination, this process leads to the formation of Br- and I-rich domains, which lower device...",
