      "description": "Trilayer graphene offers systematic control of its electronic structure through the stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in a large-angle twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5°. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality (ν(tot) = 0), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field...",
