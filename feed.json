Research aimed at understanding how hosts mount immune defenses against viruses and how viruses evade those immune defenses relies on host/virus pairs that have evolved together over time, thus necessitating a need for a DNA virus model system for Drosophila with a virus that naturally infects the host. The Drosophila innubila nudivirus (DiNV) is an emerging model system poised to take on the...",
