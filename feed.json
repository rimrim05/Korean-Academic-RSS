      "description": "The third Critical Assessment of Computational Hit-finding Experiments (CACHE) challenged computational teams to identify chemically novel ligands targeting the macrodomain 1 of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3, a promising coronavirus drug target. Twenty-three groups deployed diverse design strategies to collectively select 1739 ligand candidates. While over 85% of the designed molecules were chemically novel, the best experimentally confirmed hits were structurally similar to previously published compounds....",

However, most NAT-based detection systems cannot achieve ideal sensitivity or short assay times without efficient sample pretreatment. Although reviews have individually addressed...",

      "description": "Type I spiral ganglion neurons, which play a major role in hearing by conveying electrical sound signals to the brain, are divided into electrophysiological and molecular subtypes. The differences in vulnerability among the subtypes reported in rodents are of pathophysiological importance for age-related hearing loss. However, the changes in spiral ganglion neurons in primates and humans have not been established. In this study, we investigated the age-related changes in the spiral ganglion...",
