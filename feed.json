      "description": "Since its introduction more than 30 years ago, the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast remains the most widely used method for functional MRI (fMRI) in humans and animal models. The BOLD contrast is typically acquired with echo planar imaging (EPI) to obtain sensitization of the signal during the echo time (TE) to dynamic changes in deoxyhemoglobin content, while achieving high spatiotemporal resolution and full brain coverage. However, EPI-based fMRI also faces multiple...",
