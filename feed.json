      "description": "Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, and while somatic alterations inform diagnosis and treatment stratification, germline variants - particularly common host genome variants - rarely influence clinical care.

Yet, less than a handful have reached clinical implementation, with...",
