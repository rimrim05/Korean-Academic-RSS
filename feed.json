      "description": "Over the last decades, the traditional 'Homo economicus' model has been increasingly challenged by converging evidence highlighting the critical impact of emotions on decision-making. A classic example is the perception of unfairness in the Ultimatum Game, where humans willingly sacrifice personal gains to punish fairness norm violators. While emotional mechanisms underlying such costly punishment are widely acknowledged, the distinct contributions of moral emotions, particularly anger and...",
