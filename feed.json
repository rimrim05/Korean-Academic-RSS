To investigate eating disorder tendencies among male content creators with a mesomorphic body type (N = 26), a social media analysis was conducted on Instagram and TikTok over four weeks.

      "description": "Inadequate antigen presentation by MHC-I in tumor microenvironment (TME) is a common immune escape mechanism. Here, we show that glycine decarboxylase (GLDC), a key enzyme in glycine metabolism, functions as an inhibitor of MHC-I expression in EGFR-activated tumor cells to induce immune escape by a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity. Upon EGFR activation, GLDC is phosphorylated by SRC and subsequently translocated to the nucleus in human NSCLC cells. Nuclear GLDC sequesters STAT1...",
