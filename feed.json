Naïve dialecticism encompasses the tolerance of contradictions, the anticipation of change, and holism. By examining how these principles manifest in relationship processes and functioning that diverge from Western models, we offer a...",

To understand the molecular basis of diseases such as congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), information about the source and abundance of hexose-phosphates is imperative. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based tracer metabolomics can provide this information, but hexose-phosphates are structural isomers with similar physicochemical properties, which makes them difficult to differentiate using MS.
