      "description": "In nature, life is inherently dissipative. Cells continuously consume energy (such as ATP) to sustain homeostasis, drive metabolism, and respond dynamically to environmental cues. Inspired by this principle, we develop a synthetic protocell system that exhibits dissipative behavior and initiates metabolic-like processes. Our design features synthetic vesicles formed from a cationic surfactant, which undergo a fuel-driven transformation into coacervate protocells via liquid-liquid phase...",
