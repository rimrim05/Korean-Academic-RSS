These algae can entangle Eriocheir sinensis and release harmful substances during decomposition, thereby negatively impacting farming performance. At present, their management largely depends on non-selective herbicides, while fundamental research on species composition and biomass dynamics remains limited. In this study, 19 aquaculture ponds across five E....",
