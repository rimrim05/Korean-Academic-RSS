      "description": "Accurate prediction of ligand-induced activity for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a cornerstone of drug discovery, yet it is challenged by the need to model allosteric communication-the long-range signaling linking ligand binding to distal conformational changes. Prevailing sequence-based models often fail to capture these three-dimensional dynamics, a limitation frequently masked by averaged performance on simpler Class A targets. To address this, we introduce GPCRact, a novel framework...",

      "description": "Gastric cancer research has rapidly progressed due to interdisciplinary advances in stem cell biology and bioengineering. Gastric organoid models, particularly those derived from adult stem cells, have emerged as powerful tools that recapitulate the cellular complexity of the human stomach. This review highlights the development of various gastric organoid platforms, with a specific focus on the convergence of engineering strategies to overcome the limitations of conventional organoid systems....",
