However, systemic administration of CAR-T often results in insufficient tumor infiltration and side effects to normal organs. Given that...",

Based on our current understanding of the origin of life, it is likely that the first life forms on any extraterrestrial world would also be microbial. Due to the extreme temperatures, radiation or aridity on most planetary surfaces, such extraterrestrial microbes would most likely dwell in subsurface environments.
