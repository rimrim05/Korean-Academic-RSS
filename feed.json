Interestingly, a higher MPS seems to be associated with a lower body mass index (BMI), likewise associated with increased mortality....",

However, the molecular identity of such \"wound signals\" and their receptors on nociceptors remains unknown. In Drosophila larvae, class IV dendritic arborization neurons are multimodal nociceptors that detect harsh touch, heat, and UV light to initiate nociceptive behavior. Here, we identify Vulnusin (from vulnus, a Latin word for wound), an endogenous peptide likely serving as a wound signal. Vulnusin, derived from...",
