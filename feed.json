While the MR findings were limited by single-SNP instruments, precluding formal pleiotropy assessment, the experimental validation of miR-130a-3p and miR-132-3p strengthens the evidence. Further research with multi-SNP instruments and larger cohorts are needed to confirm causality and explore clinical relevance.",
