      "description": "The role of autophagy in glioma remains controversial, with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) playing a crucial role in its regulation. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification influences lncRNA expression and function. Specifically, lncRNA EIF3J-AS1 acts as an oncogene in glioma, yet the mechanisms driving its upregulation remain unclear. This study demonstrates that EIF3J-AS1 expression is significantly elevated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) compared to low-grade glioma (LGG) and normal brain...",
