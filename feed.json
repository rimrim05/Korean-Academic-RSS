      "description": "The mitochondrial glutamine transporter SLC1A5_var plays a central role in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells by facilitating glutamine import into mitochondria for energy production and redox homeostasis. Despite its critical function, the development of effective and selective inhibitors targeting SLC1A5_var has remained a significant challenge. Here, we introduce iMQT_020, a selective allosteric inhibitor identified through structure-based screening. iMQT_020 disrupts the trimeric...",

      "description": "The immune system plays a critical role in cancer control, but tumor cells often evade immune responses by exploiting inhibitory molecules like PD-1/PD-L1. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 interaction blockade have shown remarkable success in reactivating T-cell function in various advanced cancers, but they face limitations such as long half-life and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). In this study, we identified a new class of indoline-based scaffold through molecular docking...",

However, their random spatial distribution and inherently broad dipole emission severely hinder high-purity single-photon extraction-particularly in low-numerical-aperture (NA) optical systems, which are essential for compact and scalable quantum photonic systems. Here, a defect-selective metalens integration approach is presented that allows precise and...",

In this study, we investigated the effects of humoral factors on iPSC differentiation by culturing...",
