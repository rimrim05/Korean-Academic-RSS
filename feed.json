      "description": "Lung transplantation (LTx) offers life-saving therapy for patients with end-stage lung disease but remains limited by donor shortages, complex postoperative management and graft failure. Machine learning (ML) enables opportunities to address these challenges by identifying patterns in complex, high-dimensional data, thereby providing novel insights and improving outcomes. This review outlines ML studies in LTx and explains the methodologies. ML has demonstrated promising results in organ...",
