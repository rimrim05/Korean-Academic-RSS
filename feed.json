      "description": "Gait deficits present an unresolved therapeutic challenge in Parkinson's disease. At the behavioral level, symptoms exhibit heterogeneity, including bradykinesia and hypokinesia during cyclical limb movements, and sudden, involuntary interruptions in the gait sequence, known as freezing of gait. The neural activities driving these various deficits remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of gait sequence interruptions with a deep phenotyping approach. For this, we...",
