These wounds not only cause pain and reduce quality of life but also lead to prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of infection, and higher healthcare costs. Among the various contributing factors, malnutrition plays a crucial role by impairing collagen synthesis, weakening immune function, and delaying tissue repair. Adequate nutritional support-particularly sufficient protein...",

After a relapse at 35 years of age, she was initially treated with metyrapone but switched to osilodrostat and hydrocortisone because of nausea, achieving reasonable cortisol control....",
