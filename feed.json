      "description": "Oral drug delivery is the most common route for drug administration, because of its safety and convenience. Although there have been many drug delivery systems (DDS), inorganic clay-based nanosystems have been less explored. In particular, zinc basic salt (ZBS) has never been used as an oral DDS though it has high biocompatibility, anionic exchange capacity, and controlled release behavior. Here, we demonstrated the potency of ZBS as an oral DDS via an in vitro human follicle-associated...",
