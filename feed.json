However, their practical application faces critical challenges in achieving accurate target recognition and tracking in low-light and dynamically-changing environments. A fundamental limitation is a result of the exciton-confinement effect of QDs, which impedes efficient exciton dissociation. To overcome this...",

Among these regenerative signals, extracellular vesicles released by stem cells (SC-EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication. SC-EVs contribute to tissue repair by delivering their molecular cargo to recipient cells, modulating signaling pathways, metabolic processes, and...",

Social hierarchy is a critical behavioral regulator of stress susceptibility and a risk factor for mental disorders. Individual resilience, the ability to recover from acute stress and preclinical injury, also plays a role in PTSD susceptibility. Some...",
