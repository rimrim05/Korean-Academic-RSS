Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for the adsorption of BPs, but conventional rigid aromatic architectures suffer from limited molecular recognition capability. Herein, we design a hydroxyl-functionalized flexible aliphatic COF (TFT-TAH COF) via the polymerization of 2,3-dihydroxydicarbohydrazid (TAH)...",

Since colloidal particles are frequently used to construct stochastic heat engines, we study how the hydrodynamic flows influence the output parameters of the engine. We study a single colloidal particle confined in a harmonic trap with time-periodic stiffness that provides the engine protocol, in the presence of an externally applied steady linear shear flow. The nature of the flow (circular, elliptic, or hyperbolic) is externally...",

CPs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP, P450) monooxygenases contained in human hepatic microsomes. However, studies on the metabolism of CPs by human P450s and in silico analyses to reveal the structural basis of CP metabolism are limited. Therefore, this study showed that enzymes in human hepatic microsomes hydroxylated and dechlorinated CPs...",
