      "description": "Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) provide a promising pathway for efficient magnetization switching in magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) devices, but their quantitative evaluation is complicated by thermal artifacts. While increasing the resistivity of heavy metals can enhance the spin Hall angle through scattering mechanisms, high-resistivity systems also exhibit sizable thermoelectric signals that obscure reliable SOT extraction. In this study, we investigate SOTs in Pt/Co/HfO/Ta multilayers with...",

While previous strategies rely on fused bicyclic systems to reduce RSEs, depolymerization of non-bicyclic COE polymers has proven difficult. Here, we demonstrate efficient reversible ROMP of non-bicyclic COE derivatives by introducing conformational constraints via geminal tert-butyl and hydroxy substituents.

We found that M. bovoculi encodes both type I-C and type III-B systems, and that MboCas5 forms a dimer that is stabilized by key interactions, including a salt bridge between...",
