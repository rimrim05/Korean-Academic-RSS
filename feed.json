      "description": "This study introduces decanoyl glycol chitosan (DGC) as a novel pH-responsive injectable thermogel with enhanced dual sensitivity to temperature and pH, developed for controlled drug delivery applications. DGC was synthesized via N-decanoylation of glycol chitosan and exhibited unique multiphase sol-gel-sol transition behavior, in contrast to previous glycol chitosan-based thermogels that typically lack pH-responsiveness. The sol-gel transition occurred around 30-41 °C and reverted to a sol...",

      "description": "Telomere maintenance and metabolic reprogramming are two fundamental and interdependent hallmarks of cancer. While telomerase reactivation or the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) enables cancer cells to evade replicative senescence, metabolic rewiring sustains the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of uncontrolled proliferation. Emerging evidence indicates a dynamic bidirectional relationship between telomere dynamics and metabolism, influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME),...",

A mutation in the NPHS1 gene that codes for nephrin causes congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF). Most missense mutations render nephrin non-functional due to the defective nephrin trafficking to the cell membrane. Pharmacological approaches that induce the expression of nephrin on the cell membrane are feasible, but therapeutic development is hampered by...",

      "description": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health threat, particularly in the regions with diverse age-specific transmission patterns and increasing drug resistance. To address these challenges, this study establishes a dual-strain model that incorporates both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains to investigate how these strains contribute to the dynamics of TB transmission. By integrating age heterogeneity, social interactions, and seasonal variations, the model offers a detailed...",
