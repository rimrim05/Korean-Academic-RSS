      "description": "Structural DNA nanotechnology enables the programmable construction of nano- to microscale assemblies with high resolution, yet predicting their mechanical behavior prior to synthesis remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce SNUPI, a computational framework that predicts the shape and mechanical responses of structured DNA assemblies using finite element-based analysis. SNUPI uses design files from caDNAno and performs static analysis, normal-mode analysis, and Langevin dynamics...",
