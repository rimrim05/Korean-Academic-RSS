Eukaryotic cells maintain millimolar levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) as a major antioxidative strategy.

Here, we show that protein S-glutathionylation promotes stress granule (SG) assembly, creating reductive microenvironments within an oxidized...",

      "description": "The implications of the neuroimmune system in the pathogenesis of alcohol use disorders (AUD) have been undeniable. Understanding how chronic alcohol dysregulates inflammatory pathways in the brain leading to altered neuronal functions could provide insight into specific mechanisms and neuroadaptations that may contribute to drinking behaviors. For example, the neuroadaptations at inhibitory GABAergic synapses in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) of rodents and macaques involve the...",
