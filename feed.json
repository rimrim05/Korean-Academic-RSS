This recognition has prompted a recent focus on understanding urban systems via interactions between human social systems and ecological and evolutionary processes. Most research has focused on interactions between two of these three domains. Here we present a framework for linking all three - social, ecological, and evolutionary - by focusing on phenotypic response and effect traits,...",

      "description": "Previous studies in adult mice indicate that the mGluR5 agonist 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenyl glycine (CHPG), reduces cuprizone-elicited losses in myelin. This effect is partly mediated by CHPG binding to mGluR5 receptors on reactive astrocytes, triggering the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in an increase in myelin. However, it remains unclear whether CHPG has similar beneficial effects on human oligodendrocytes. To address this issue, we examined effects of CHPG...",
