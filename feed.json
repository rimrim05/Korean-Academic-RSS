Simultaneous occurrence of stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in such patients have rarely been reported. Here, we describe two patients with HES who suffered from ischemic stroke complicated by ICH. In case 1, we used a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke without treating hypereosinophilia; consequently, ICH occurred. In case 2, the patient had an...",
