      "description": "Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable Z_{2} quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSLs), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and Z_{2} topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of \"fractionalized altermagnets (AM^{*})\" emerge, which can be...",
