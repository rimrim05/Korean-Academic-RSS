      "description": "Astrocytes are critical contributors to brain disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying their selective vulnerability to specific diseases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that NR3C1 acts as a key regulator of early postnatal astrocyte development, shaping long-term immune responses in mice. Through integrative analyses of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and long-range chromatin interactions, we identify 55 stage-specific TFs, with NR3C1 uniquely associated with early...",
