In the present study, we examined whether N. bacilliformis exacerbates periodontitis in a mouse ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) model and investigated its underlying molecular mechanism. Topical treatment with N. bacilliformis on maxillary second molar exacerbated...",

In optogenetics, microbially derived photoreceptor proteins such as channelrhodopsin (ChR) have been widely used. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-type opsins have signal amplification capabilities and are emerging as promising candidates for high-sensitivity optogenetic tools....",
