However, detailed mechanisms underlying IL-15-induced bystander activation remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the molecular regulation of bystander activation and NK-like cytotoxicity of human CCR7^(-)...",

Although 3D ABUS automatic segmentation models have been explored to alleviate labor-intensive tasks for doctors, the models are still limited by variations in tumor size and shape, lesion-related artifacts, and/or small datasets. Transformer models offer increased capacity, but they are susceptible to overfitting with small data sets. Here, we demonstrate a 3D...",
