      "description": "Simultaneously achieving a large second-harmonic generation (SHG) response and high laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) remains a critical scientific challenge in mid-infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Computational studies demonstrate that Al(2)Se(3) exhibits a large NLO coefficient and an ultrawide bandgap among selenides. However, its instability excludes the application potential, which attracts us to design its derivatives. Novel AlGaSe(3) can be obtained via a chemical...",

      "description": "Mosquitoes serve as vectors for a variety of pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases, such as malaria, dengue, Zika, and yellow fever. With the rise of antimalarial drug resistance and a lack of therapeutics or prophylactics for dengue and Zika, current disease control strategies rely heavily on mosquito population management. However, the effectiveness of conventional approaches is increasingly compromised, highlighting an urgent need for innovative tools to combat mosquito-borne...",
