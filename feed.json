      "description": "Thermochemical energy storage using Mg(OH)(2) is attractive due to its high energy density, low cost, and nontoxicity. However, its practical application is limited by the high dehydration temperature required to achieve sufficient reaction rates. Although metal salt additives are known to enhance dehydration kinetics, prior studies have mainly focused on powders, with limited research on pellets. Unlike powders, pellet manufacturing involves high-temperature sintering for mechanical stability,...",

Although PEDOT:PSS is widely used as an HTL material, its intrinsic acidity and structural instability hinder the performance of the OPD. Here, imidazole-induced neutralization promotes a linear entangled structure, while...",
