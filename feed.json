      "description": "A crucial performance ceiling has long limited carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes in demanding gas separations, a limitation stemming directly from the inability to precisely dictate their ultramicroporous architecture. Herein, we demonstrate a novel lanthanum (La)-doping strategy to precisely control the structural evolution of polyimide-based carbon CMS membranes. Lanthanum incorporation fundamentally alters pyrolysis dynamics by significantly increasing aromatic strand mobility and...",
