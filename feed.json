Biomimetic strategies offer promising solutions by using advanced 3D scaffolds guided by natural tissue cues. Recent advances in additive manufacturing, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering now allow the fabrication of hierarchical scaffolds that closely mimic native bone. Smart scaffold systems combine materials with biochemical and mechanical signals. These features...",
