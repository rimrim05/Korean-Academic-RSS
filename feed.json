      "description": "Axions, originally proposed to resolve the CP problem in the strong interaction, remain a leading dark matter candidate. While cavity haloscopes offer the most sensitive technique for detecting axions, searches have largely been limited to masses below 10 μeV. We report a sensitive search for axion dark matter with masses around 21 μeV, utilizing the TM_{020} mode of a cylindrical cavity equipped with an innovative tuning mechanism. Our search achieved a sensitivity of 1.7× the...",

However, obtaining reliable brain markers for early classification of young children with HL versus those with normal hearing (NH), as well as for precise assessment of HL children's language ability, remains a challenge due to limitations in traditional neuroimaging techniques and theoretical frameworks.
