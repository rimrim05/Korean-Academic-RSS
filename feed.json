      "description": "The low-temperature synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is essential for next-generation electronics, but this process remains a challenge. Generally, conventional methods require high temperatures, whereas existing low-temperature approaches depend on extrinsic modifications, such as plasma enhancement or specialized precursors, to enhance reactivity. In this study, a novel fundamental strategy was introduced on the basis of the intrinsic electronic engineering of transition...",

      "description": "Gut microbiota composition has been extensively studied in European and North American pediatric cohorts, as well as in rural African children. Much less attention has been paid to urban African children, whose families have transitioned to a \"Western\" lifestyle characterized by smaller family sizes, access to perinatal care including C-section delivery, non-traditional food sources and widespread availability of antibiotics. We analyzed fecal samples from ~200 Ethiopian children aged 2-5 years...",
