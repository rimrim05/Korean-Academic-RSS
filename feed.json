Conventional attenuated total reflection (ATR)-IR probes offer real-time measurement capabilities but are limited by shallow penetration depths of the evanescent wave, restricting detection mainly to high-concentration species and surface-localized events. To overcome these limitations, we built an endoscopic Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) probe for in operando chemical...",

      "description": "John B. Gurdon approached biology with characteristic clarity and patience, asking not only what happens in development, but how much of a molecule is present, and for how long. His nuclear-transfer experiments revealed that cellular identity is not fixed but can be reset, reshaping both biology and medicine. Through studies of oocytes, translational control, and the community effect, he showed that stability in living systems arises from persistence and interaction. His influence reached far...",
