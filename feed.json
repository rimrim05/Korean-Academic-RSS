This organism undergoes 2 distinct stages in its life cycle, the trophozoite and the cyst. Under adverse conditions, trophozoites transform into cysts, which are notably resistant to harsh physical and chemical conditions. Infected by Legionella pneumophila has been shown to decrease the number of cysts in its host Acanthamoeba species, although the mechanisms responsible for this effect remain...",

      "description": "Mantle plumes beneath major oceanic hot spots appear to be rooted in unusually large structures near the core-mantle boundary, which have markedly reduced seismic wave speeds. The origin of these large ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs), referred to as mega-ULVZs, remains uncertain partly because of lack of constraints on the relative reduction in shear versus compressional wave speeds (R(S/P)). This ratio can give clues into the compositional makeup of the mega-ULVZs. Through joint seismic...",

Active mobility is a key factor influencing healthy ageing, social inclusion, and quality of life; however, its improvement requires a systemic approach connecting urban planning, public health, and social policy. In Montenegro, rapid urbanization, insufficient infrastructure, and limited intersectoral...",
