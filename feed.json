While the majority of tumors activate telomerase, a significant subset-approximately 10-15%-utilizes alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a recombination-based mechanism. ALT-positive cancers are classically associated with genomic instability, anaphase bridges, chromosomal rearrangements, and resistance to DNA-damaging therapies. This process is closely associated with genetic instability, which...",
