      "description": "Achieving vibrant, energy-efficient colour modulation across micrometre-scale pixels is a critical challenge in modern display technology. Conventional approaches face limitations in scalability, high operating voltages, and light loss. Emerging monopixel designs with active materials promise a path to dynamic colour modulation without these drawbacks. However, achieving uniform, energy-efficient colour modulation across the full visible spectrum has remained difficult. Here, we introduce a...",

However, the clinical application of EVs is impeded by their instability, limited tissue penetration, and lack of targeted delivery to ovarian injury sites. Here, we introduce an injectable hydrogel loaded with nanomotor-driven EVs (LEVs-Gel) for targeted POI therapy. In the POI ovarian microenvironment, reactive...",

      "description": "Drug transporters play essential roles in governing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of therapeutic drugs. Transporter modulation frequently contributes to clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs). This review provides a comprehensive overview of in vitro transporter assay systems and their applications in mechanistic characterization and prediction of transporter-mediated DDIs. Current global regulatory guidelines, including ICH M12, highlight key...",
