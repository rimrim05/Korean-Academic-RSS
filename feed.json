Silicon monoxide/graphite (SiO/Gr) composite anodes have attracted considerable attention as promising candidates for increasing energy density. However, severe capacity degradation caused by the large volume changes of SiO during charge-discharge cycles remains a major obstacle to commercialization. One effective strategy to address this issue is to limit the charge/discharge...",

Conventional therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, have limited effect, and targeted or immune-based treatments provide only transient benefit. Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has recently emerged as a therapeutic vulnerability in ATC....",
