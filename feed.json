      "description": "Pathological neuroinflammation is a critical factor that disrupts neuronal activity and, when sustained, ultimately contributes to neuronal death. Among the primary mediators of neuroinflammation, microglia play a central role in modulating brain immunity. However, their overactivation is closely associated with neuronal damage and structural remodeling of brain tissue, leading to the onset and progression of various neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective...",

Overactive agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, located in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, are a hallmark of diabetic states, and their long-term inhibition has been linked to FGF1's antidiabetic effects. To investigate the underlying mechanism(s), we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the mediobasal hypothalamus at...",
