      "description": "Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, respiratory complications and cognitive dysfunction, affecting approximately 13.5% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Despite its clinical significance, the mechanisms driving PASC remain poorly understood. Here, to address this, we utilized a Phodopus roborovskii hamster model to investigate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with influenza A virus. While 46.25-47.50% of...",
