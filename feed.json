      "description": "Solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted considerable attention in applications such as energy storage systems and electrical devices due to their intrinsic safety and high energy density. Among them, layered oxide-based SEs exhibit high stability, reasonable ionic conductivity, and lower sintering temperatures compared with other oxide-based SEs. Nevertheless, the demand for higher ionic conductivity and lower synthesis temperatures still persists. To address these challenges, this work explores...",

The behavior of the beetle plays a crucial role in the spread of the pinewood nematode among host pine trees. Here, we...",

      "description": "Vitronectin (VTN) is a multifunctional glycoprotein that promotes cell adhesion and survival signaling through interactions with integrins. Elevated serum VTN levels have recently emerged as diagnostic and prognostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet its mechanistic role in HCC progression remains unclear. Here, we show that VTN knockdown in HCC cells has minimal effects on cell migration and viability, raising the possibility that VTN may promote tumor progression by shaping the...",
