      "description": "The rapid growth of the Li-ion battery industry has promoted the development of breakthrough materials and systems; nevertheless, achieving desired performance through sophisticated designs within well-established systems has also become essential. Here, it is demonstrated that precise control of the lithium-to-transition-metal (Li/M) ratio serves as a commercially viable lever to tune the voltage profile of Ni-rich cathodes. This arises from the combined effects of Ni defect at Li sites...",
