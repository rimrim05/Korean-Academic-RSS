The FLG was functionalized in two steps to produce a secondary functionalized FLG (FLG-PEG), resulting in improved dispersion in water, as characterized using an optical microscope. Morphological analysis revealed that FLG-PEG nanosheets are well dispersed, resulting in a smoother, more uniform composite film with the polymer wrapping around them....",
