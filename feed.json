However, higher luminance levels do not inherently lead to enhanced reading comfort. Prior research indicates that reading comfort is influenced by a combination of monitor...",

      "description": "Dysphonia, or impaired voice quality, is common in hospitalized patients and can impair communication, signal underlying disease, and worsen outcomes. Ultimately, this negatively impacts quality of life, increases resource utilization, and often coexists with dysphagia. Causes include surgical injury, intubation, infection, neurologic disease, and malignancy. Diagnosis relies on history and physical examination, often inclusive of laryngoscopy performed by otolaryngologists. Treatment is...",
