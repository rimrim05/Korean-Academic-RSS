This paper demonstrates a strain-driven approach for selectively stabilizing the metastable phases of orthorhombic TiO(2)-II and rutile using (111)-oriented face-centered cubic (FCC) metal substrates via low-temperature atomic layer deposition. Epitaxial FCC metal substrates, including Ir and Pt, exhibit a strong preferential (111) orientation and promote the formation of TiO(2)-II with a preferential (200)...",
