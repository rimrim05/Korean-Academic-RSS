      "description": "The 2D electron gas (2DEG) is a successful testbed for investigating both small and large polarons, governed by enhanced fundamental couplings through dimensional confinement. However, accessible polaronic states are typically limited to low carrier densities, as polarons collapse due to enforced electronic screening at high densities. This has limited exploration into polaron interactions, including bipolaron formation, inter-polaron correlations, and broader collective polaron behaviors. Here,...",
