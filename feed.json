      "description": "Previous studies in adult mice indicate that the mGluR5 agonist 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenyl glycine (CHPG), reduces cuprizone-elicited losses in myelin. This effect is partly mediated by CHPG binding to mGluR5 receptors on reactive astrocytes, triggering the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which results in an increase in myelin. However, it remains unclear whether CHPG has similar beneficial effects on human oligodendrocytes. To address this issue, we examined effects of CHPG...",
