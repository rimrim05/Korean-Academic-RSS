Although zeolite structures are known to significantly influence their diffusion properties, determining how a specific structure impacts diffusion performance is challenging. This difficulty arises from a lack of methodologies for quantifying structural factors and linking correlated variables to the diffusion performance. To address this challenge, this study utilizes a data-driven...",

This study assessed how muscle protein density responds to challenges such as exercise, injury, immobilization and disease, and associated this with measures of lean mass, radiodensity, functionality and damage. The protein density was determined in human muscle biopsies from older adults (65-83...",

In general, MP-VTST calculations include the contributions of all of the reaction paths; however, to reduce the computational cost for relatively large molecules, the number of...",
