Despite standard treatments such as botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections, oral medications, and deep brain stimulation therapy, many patients continue to experience persistent symptoms. There is growing evidence supporting the use of rehabilitation-based therapies in the management of certain forms of dystonia. This review summarizes the current body of evidence, which...",
