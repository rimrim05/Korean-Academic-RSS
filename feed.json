      "description": "Radiative cooling offers a passive and energy-efficient approach to thermal regulation, yet most conventional implementations lack dynamic tunability under varying environmental conditions. Recent advances in switchable radiative cooling materials have shown potential for practical applications, but their transient optical behaviors remain underexplored due to the limitations of conventional spectrophotometers. In this study, a real-time transmittance measurement system is developed that...",
