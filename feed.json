To enhance ORR performance and durability, extensive studies have investigated transition metal alloying, doping, and shape control to optimize the three key governing factors for ORR: geometry, local chemistry, and strain of their surface and subsurface. However, systematic optimization remains incomplete, as it requires an atomic-scale understanding of these factors...",

The sensor, measuring 1.5 mm × 0.5 mm, consists of three main parts: the conductor for excitation current flow, the magnetic layer sensitive to an external magnetic field, and the detection coil for measuring output voltage dependent on an external magnetic field. The magnetic layer forms a magnetically closed-circuit in the cross-section, which reduces reluctance and power consumption. Key fabrication...",
