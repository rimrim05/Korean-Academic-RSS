It extended the system's operational period by about 2.2 times compared to a conventional MBR. Membrane fouling mitigation was attributed to quorum-quenching activity, reducing microbial products...",

We previously found that GIM3 genetically interacts with many de novo mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Removing GIM3 from mutagenized S. cerevisiae cells significantly affected the fitness effect of mutations. This indicates that Gim3 might change the evolutionary impact of de novo mutations by either buffering (hiding) or potentiating (increasing) their phenotypic effects,...",
