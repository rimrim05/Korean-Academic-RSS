As the widely prescribed hypnotics that positively modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor activity have various safety concerns, there is a growing demand for the development of novel hypnotics that act on targets other than GABAA receptor signaling to overcome the drawbacks of current medications. As an alternative target to generate novel hypnotics, the orexin system has recently gained much attention, and 3 dual orexin receptor...",
