Conversely, disruption of the DNMT3A domain that binds NSD1-deposited H3K36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) results in growth restriction. To investigate the molecular basis of these opposing growth outcomes, we generated isogenic human embryonic stem cells carrying growth syndrome-associated mutations in DNMT3A and NSD1. Unexpectedly, both overgrowth- and growth...",

Three tests were used to measure cognitive function. Nutritional status was calculated by GNRI scores. Subjects were 2283 older adults. Low GNRI levels were a risk factor for normal performance on the AFT and DSST tests.The results of restricted spline regression models indicated an approximately linear dose-response relationship between GNRI and the prevalence of low...",
