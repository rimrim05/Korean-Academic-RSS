Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, Ribo-seq, and CLIP-seq data revealed that ribosomal protein (RP)...",

      "description": "Many biological tissues, such as cardiac muscle, tendons, and the cornea, exhibit highly organized microstructural alignment that is critical for mechanical and physiological functions. Disruptions in this structural organization are commonly associated with pathological conditions such as fibrosis, infarction, and cancer. However, conventional histological imaging techniques rely on immunofluorescence or histochemical staining, and they evaluate tissue alignment via non-physical 2D...",
