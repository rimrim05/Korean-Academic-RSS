      "description": "Previous studies have shown that BPH1 represses the abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated cellular responses. To further understand the mechanism of action of BPH1 in ABA signaling, the putative binding partners of BPH1 were investigated. Arabidopsis stress associated protein 9 (AtSAP9), which acts as a positive regulator of ABA signaling, has been identified as a BPH1-binding protein. Both BPH1 and AtSAP9 proteins were localized in the nucleus and cytosol, and a direct interaction between BPH1 and...",

However, it remains unclear how much carbon is available to microbes, and if soil organic carbon content influences microbial carbon limitation. Here, the Michaelis-Menten parameters (V(max) and k(m)) were employed to estimate available carbon and the degree of carbon limitation along soil depth profiles (0-60 cm) at two study sites with varying soil organic carbon content. Available carbon as well as...",

In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of the novel YTHDF1 inhibitor ebselen in breast cancer cells. Ebselen treatment reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by Annexin V staining, Sub-G1 accumulation, and DNA fragmentation. Consistently, ebselen increased reactive oxygen species...",
