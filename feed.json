      "description": "We prove the invariance of scalar Feynman graphs of any planar topology under the Yangian level-one momentum symmetry given certain constraints on the propagator powers. The proof relies on relating this symmetry to a planarized version of the conformal simplices of Bzowski, McFadden, and Skenderis. In particular, this proves a momentum-space analogue of the position-space conformal condition on propagator powers. When combined with the latter, the invariance under the level-one momentum implies...",
