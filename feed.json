      "description": "Previous studies have shown that BPH1 represses the abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated cellular responses. To further understand the mechanism of action of BPH1 in ABA signaling, the putative binding partners of BPH1 were investigated. Arabidopsis stress associated protein 9 (AtSAP9), which acts as a positive regulator of ABA signaling, has been identified as a BPH1-binding protein. Both BPH1 and AtSAP9 proteins were localized in the nucleus and cytosol, and a direct interaction between BPH1 and...",

      "description": "Halogen-free solvent processing is critical for the industrial-scale production of organic solar cells (OSCs) and environmental sustainability. However, such solvents typically result in suboptimal efficiency due to excessive molecular aggregation and unfavorable phase separation. To address this issue, an innovative anti-solvent (AS) strategy is proposed that accelerates photovoltaic material precipitation by timed introduction of orthogonal solvents to reduce solvent solubility and enhance...",
