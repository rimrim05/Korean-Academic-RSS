Lett. 96, 060406 (2006)] to incorporate multiple observables for tripartite systems and introduce a geometric methodology for calculating classical upper bounds of the inequalities. Our method transforms the problem of finding the classical upper bounds into identifying constraints in linear congruence relations. Using this approach, we derive the upper bounds for scenarios with three and four observables per...",

However, the prevalence of kidney disease among individuals with chronic HCV infection is unknown. Concerns about the quality of kidneys from deceased donors with HCV infection may lead centers to avoid transplanting these organs.",
