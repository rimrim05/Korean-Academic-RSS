      "description": "Vertical NAND (V-NAND) flash memory has emerged as a promising candidate for neuromorphic computing platforms due to its high density, scalability, and reliability. However, synaptic weights stored in V-NAND cells are highly sensitive to ambient temperature variations, resulting in significant conductance shifts that degrade the inference accuracy of neural networks. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic pass bias (DPB) control scheme that compensates for temperature-induced weight...",
