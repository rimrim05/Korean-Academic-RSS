At selected temperatures, fluorescence switching was nearly complete, with a slight pH variation of <1 unit. The fluorescence-switching mechanism involved a proton-induced three-dimensional structural change in the polymer, which altered local hydrophobicity near the environment-sensitive fluorescent units.

Using single-cell DNA sequencing, we found that PTPN11 mutations can occur as initiating events in some patients with AML when accompanied by strong oncogenic drivers, commonly NPM1 mutations. The resulting AML has a diverse set of variably differentiated myeloid cells with few myeloid cells that lack leukemic mutations. The role of...",
