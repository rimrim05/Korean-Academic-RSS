Coordination of the amide carbonyl to Rh may promote insertion and suppress β-fluoride elimination, enabling efficient formation of fluorinated cyclic products with high enantioselectivity. This strategy provides streamlined access to complex...",

      "description": "Self-association of low-complexity protein sequences (LC domains) is important for polymer formation. Several molecular chaperones are involved in the regulation of LC domain polymer formation. However, the mechanisms underlying cell recognition of LC domain polymers remain unclear. Here we show that zinc finger domains (ZnFs) bind LC domains of RNA-binding proteins in a cross-β polymer-dependent manner. ZnFs bound to LC domain hydrogels and suppressed LC domain polymer formation. Moreover, ZnFs...",
