      "description": "The electroreduction of carbon monoxide (CO) provides a sustainable pathway to valuable multi-carbon (C(2+)) products, contributing to carbon neutrality. Enhancing coupling efficiency and selectivity for C(2+) formation hinges on precise control of the spatial arrangement of catalytic sites where CO molecules adsorb. Here, we introduce a structurally well-defined Cu(I) dual-atom catalyst (DAC) embedded in a metal-organic framework (MOF) that is synthesized via a thermal transformation....",

      "description": "We study the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on orbital magnetism in Pb(1-x)Sn(x)Te, a narrow-gap semiconductor. Using theπ-matrix method, we calculate material-specific Landau levels and evaluate the magnetization, fully including interband eﬀects. The system exhibits diamagnetism for bothx= 0 andx= 0.35, with the latter showing a stronger response due to its smaller gap. The magnitude of diamagnetism increases monotonically with SOC strength, particularly in strong magnetic fields. To...",
