      "description": "Computed tomography is acknowledged as the most widely used imaging technique in both adults and children. Although computed tomography offers valuable diagnostic information, it contributes to a high radiation dose and poses relatively high risks of stochastic effects to patients. Stochastic risks are of special concern in pediatric imaging since children are more vulnerable to effects of ionizing radiation than adults. Therefore, the justification of pediatric computed tomography examinations...",

      "description": "We investigate the influence of thermal noise on the formation and dynamics of vortex of self-propelled particles (SPPs) around a circular obstacle using numerical simulations. In the absence of symmetry-breaking factors, spherical SPPs can spontaneously form a sustained vortex near the obstacle when particle activity is sufficiently high and the obstacle size lies within a suitable range. We show that noise not only induces transition between the vortex state and the random state but also plays...",
