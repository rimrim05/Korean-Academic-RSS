Neurocaf was characterized for the presence of 5-hydroxytryptamide esters, eicosanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamide (EHT), and chlorogenic acids using HPLC-PDA detector. The inhibitory kinetics of Neurocaf against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were assessed in vitro. Cognitive efficacy was further investigated in a scopolamine-induced amnesia mouse model. In a 25-day study, male Swiss albino mice...",
