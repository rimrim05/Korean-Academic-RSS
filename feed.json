Here, the TL mechanisms of chiral lanthanide complexes (LnL^(val), Ln = Eu, Tb, Sm, Dy, and Gd) were elucidated by focusing on the role of lamellar cleavage of the crystal structure. The modified drop tower system (DTS) quantifies mechanical stimuli used to observe the TL spectra. Chiral EuL^(val) and TbL^(val) exhibit...",

However, the underlying neural mechanisms are currently unknown. When applied to the human motor cortex, a-tDCS reduces the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that modulates neuroplasticity. Our primary aim was to assess whether the same a-tDCS paradigm alters local GABA...",
