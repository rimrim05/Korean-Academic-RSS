      "description": "Conjugated polymer cathodes are promising candidates for next-generation Li-ion batteries, but their practical application is limited by the presence of inactive alkyl side chains that reduce specific capacity. A simple heat-treatment strategy is reported to selectively remove the alkyl side chains of a naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based polymer, P(NDI2OD-T2), an n-type conjugated polymer, resulting in a nearly twofold increase in specific capacity, from 56.3 mAh g^(-1) (fresh) to 117.0 mAh g^(-1)...",

      "description": "Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is an approach for quantum chemical calculations using current quantum computers. In conventional QSCI, Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is...",
