      "description": "Various studies have explored mechanical impedance control strategies in soft actuators to enhance stability and precision, as the nonlinear characteristics of soft materials frequently lead to unwanted oscillations. Among these approaches, electrostatic (ES) clutches have shown promise for achieving friction-based mechanical impedance control; however, conventional ES clutches are limited by issues such as residual charge accumulation and stick-slip behavior, which compromise force stability...",

Recent efforts to replace Pb metal with tin (Sn) face challenges due to Sn's oxidation instability, limiting its use in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs). While Sn metal additives are traditionally utilized to mitigate the oxidation of Sn^(2+), alternative stabilization strategies remain unexplored. In this study, an...",

Using an information-theoretic decomposition of eigenstate entropy, we demonstrate that spatial delocalization may...",
