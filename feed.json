      "description": "The practical deployment of lithium metal batteries remains severely constrained, especially under elevated temperatures. Although metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) improve the thermal stability of liquid electrolytes by capturing them in well-ordered sub-nanopores, interparticle voids between MOF particles readily absorb liquid electrolyte, obscuring our understanding of the intrinsic role of nanopores in directing Li⁺ transport. To address this challenge, we introduce a one-dimensional (1D) MOF...",

Large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have emerged as tools providing medical information, but their ability to interpret real-world neuropsychological test results remains unevaluated. This study investigates whether LLMs can provide accurate, patient-friendly...",

      "description": "In the context of three-dimensional angle-of-arrival (3D-AOA) target tracking, this study proposes a state-constrained and noise-separated pseudo-linear Kalman filtering (SC-NS-PLKF) algorithm to address nonlinear filtering challenges. Whereas existing bias-compensated (BC), instrumental-variable (IV) and unbiased (UB) PLKF methods only correct the pseudo-linear bias, SC-NS-PLKF achieves high-precision unbiased estimation with enhanced algorithmic stability. Specifically, this method (i) derives...",

In response to these tasks, the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver formed a multidisciplinary commission to address the unmet needs of people affected by liver diseases....",
