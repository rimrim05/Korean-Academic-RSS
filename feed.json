Here, we identify cell density as key regulator of SETDB1 subcellular localization and demonstrate its role in modulating the Hippo signaling pathway. Under low-density culture, SETDB1 distributes between nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas high-density culture triggers nuclear exclusion and proteasomal degradation. SETDB1 depletion reduces YAP1 phosphorylation...",
