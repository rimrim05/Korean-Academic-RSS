In this study, we investigate a series of dicopper hydride complexes supported by PNNP expanded pincer ligands that vary in both aggregation and ligand protonation state. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we examine how these properties correlate and identify key structural and electronic factors that govern aggregation. Our analysis shows...",
