      "description": "This study introduces decanoyl glycol chitosan (DGC) as a novel pH-responsive injectable thermogel with enhanced dual sensitivity to temperature and pH, developed for controlled drug delivery applications. DGC was synthesized via N-decanoylation of glycol chitosan and exhibited unique multiphase sol-gel-sol transition behavior, in contrast to previous glycol chitosan-based thermogels that typically lack pH-responsiveness. The sol-gel transition occurred around 30-41 °C and reverted to a sol...",
