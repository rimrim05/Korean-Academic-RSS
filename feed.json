      "description": "Prior studies link intimate partner violence (IPV) to poor mental health, especially among those with low socioeconomic status or limited support. However, few have explored how housing conditions may moderate these psychological effects. This study investigates the relationship between IPV and psychological well-being, with a particular focus on two outcomes: depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. It also examines whether housing conditions amplify or mitigate individuals' psychological...",
