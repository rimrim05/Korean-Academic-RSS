In recent years, enzyme-immobilized electrodes have been developed by combining enzyme biofuel cells with microfluidic technology to improve the efficiency and performance of fuel cells. In this review, we will provide an overview and describe the current status of recent...",

The mechanochemical N(2)O decomposition method exhibited a rapid reaction rate of 1761.3 mL h^(-1) and a high...",
