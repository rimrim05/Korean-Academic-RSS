      "description": "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides critical insights into the molecular and electronic structures of complex condensed-phase systems. For example, the XAS spectrum of liquid water depends on the complex three-dimensional arrangements of water molecules and their effects on the core-to-valence electronic transitions. Consequently, a wealth of molecular and electronic information is encoded in the complex spectral patterns. To decode these structure-electronic property relationships, we...",

Simultaneously slowly acidifying and removing cations, EDBM maintains a distinct mineral profile that enhances ultrafiltration (UF) performance, reduces membrane fouling, and improves the properties of milk protein concentrates. EDBM-treated UF...",

Rice bran oil (RBO) has excellent oxidative stability due to its fatty acid (FA) composition with relatively more saturated FA and less polyunsaturated FA along with a variety of antioxidants and is therefore expected to be used in blend with other vegetable oils. However, there are limited studies demonstrating the benefits of blending RBO. Our earlier study revealed that blending RBO,...",
