      "description": "As semiconductor technologies advance, SRAM cells deployed in space systems face heightened sensitivity to radiation-induced soft errors. In conventional 6T SRAM, when high-energy particles strike sensitive nodes, single-event upsets (SEUs) may occur, flipping stored bits. Furthermore, with aggressive scaling, charge sharing among adjacent devices can trigger single-event multi-node upsets (SEMNU). To address these reliability concerns, this study presents a radiation-hardened SRAM design,...",

The self-assembled cages retained high fluorescence quantum yields (Φ(F) = 0.50 for Pd(2)L1(4)), exhibited significant circular dichroism (CD)/circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity for Pd(2)L2(4), and displayed guest-encapsulating behavior owing to the inherent oxahelicene ligands.
