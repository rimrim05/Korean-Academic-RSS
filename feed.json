      "description": "High-resolution retinal fundus images are critical for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, yet clinical datasets often contain low-resolution images that obscure fine vascular structures essential for accurate diagnosis. Existing super-resolution methods face a fundamental trade-off: convolutional neural networks produce overly smooth results, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) risk creating hallucinated artifacts. We propose the Dual-Transformer Residual Super-Resolution Network...",
