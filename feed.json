Mouse cell line models are useful to study an immunologically intact tumor microenvironment, especially in the setting of CAR-T studies that often use immunocompromised mice. To establish a mouse cell line faithfully recapitulating human gastric cancer, we generated the S6M cell line from an autochthonous gastric cancer formed in the stomach of a female...",

However, the structural-function relationship of this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we report that the previously observed neutralization of LL-37 toxicity against POPC membranes by HNP1 is not unique to this pair but can be extended to...",

However, the underlying mechanisms driving asymmetry patterns remain unclear. This study tested two competing hypotheses concerning behavioural lateralization, using pet dogs as a model: the Valence hypothesis, which posits that lateralization is shaped by emotional valence (positive vs. negative), and the Approach-Withdrawal hypothesis, which suggests that...",
