      "description": "Accurate prediction of ligand-induced activity for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a cornerstone of drug discovery, yet it is challenged by the need to model allosteric communication-the long-range signaling linking ligand binding to distal conformational changes. Prevailing sequence-based models often fail to capture these three-dimensional dynamics, a limitation frequently masked by averaged performance on simpler Class A targets. To address this, we introduce GPCRact, a novel framework...",
