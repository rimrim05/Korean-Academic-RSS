      "description": "Photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis is a promising approach for converting solar energy into chemical fuels, but a fundamental challenge lies in balancing catalytic activity with efficient light absorption. Catalyst surface coverage on light-harvesting supports often leads to a trade-off that limits overall performance. To address this issue, we developed a high-aspect-ratio (>20) gold (Au) nanopatterned catalyst designed to maximize both light harvesting and catalytic efficiency. Compared to...",
