      "description": "MOTIVATION: Understanding temporal gene expression is fundamental in the study of cellular development and differentiation. In practice, temporal single-cell datasets tend to contain only a limited number of measured time points, which are often unevenly spaced, resulting in irregular intervals between observations due to experimental constraints. Existing methods typically address these intervals by sequentially predicting one time point after another, yet lack mechanisms to explicitly model...",

However, current treatments are limited by side effects, frequent dosing, and the stratum corneum (SC) barrier with topical administration. Baicalin (BA) is a natural ingredient showing promise in treating AGA, but its poor water solubility and low bioavailability limit its clinical application. To address the challenges of BA solubility, skin barrier, and patient...",
