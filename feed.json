Due to the small volume loss involved, diamond wear is challenging to quantify, specifically for multicontact interfaces. Consequently, identifying which wear mechanisms dominate the degradation of macroscopically loaded diamond interfaces has remained an open challenge. Using a topography difference method based on atomic force microscopy imaging, we observe the wear of multi-asperity microcrystalline diamond (MCD) surfaces sliding...",

      "description": "A bioinspired thiolate-bridged iron-molybdenum complex was designed and synthesized, featuring structural motifs similar to those found in the {FeS(3)Mo} moiety of FeMoco. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that it contains a low-spin Fe^(II) centre and a Mo^(IV) centre with weak metal-metal bonding. Furthermore, it has been proven to be a good catalyst for hydrazine disproportionation.",
