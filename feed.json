Although most of the Japanese populations possess ZW sex chromosomes (female heterogamety), the degree of sex chromosome differentiation varies among populations.

      "description": "Spondylocostal dysostosis (SCDO) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal development of the axial skeleton, resulting in malformations of the vertebrae and ribs that often impair lung development and lead to significant respiratory morbidity. SCDO is thought to arise from defects in the paraxial presomitic mesoderm, an embryonic tissue that forms the vertebral column and ribs. Pathogenic variants in DLL3, MESP2, LFNG, HES7, TBX6, and RIPPLY2 have been identified in various SCDO...",
