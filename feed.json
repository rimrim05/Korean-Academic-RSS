      "description": "Achieving both high sensitivity and a wide detection range in flexible pressure sensors poses a challenge due to their inherent trade-off. Although porous structures offer promising solutions, conventional methods (templating, foaming, and freeze-drying) fail to precisely control cavity dimensions, spatial arrangement, and 3D morphology, which are crucial for sensing performance. Here, we propose a scalable fabrication strategy that integrates triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS)...",

      "description": "Linear carbon cluster anions, such as C6-, have been considered to be promising candidate interstellar molecules. Recent experiments have demonstrated that in a collision-free vacuum environment, C6- exhibits fast radiative cooling from its highly vibrationally excited states through inverse internal conversion (IIC). Since IIC is driven by vibronic coupling, the understanding of vibronic structures of C6- is of theoretical significance. Here, we utilize time-dependent density functional theory...",
