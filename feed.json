      "description": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a chronic genetic condition that leads to progressive loss of photoreceptor cells and vision. While gene therapy is available for a small subset of patients with specific mutations, developing a therapeutic that broadly targets the cellular stresses that lead to cell death could address a major unmet need. One such option would be utilizing antioxidant therapies to neutralize reaction oxygen species (ROS) in the retina that underlie RP progression. Here, we describe...",
