      "description": "Origami structures are lightweight and reconfigurable, creating 3D shapes by folding 2D facets. However, increasing bending stiffness in a 3D shape is challenging because the structure needs to undergo transformation, and the thin facets are easily bent. This problem is especially critical in an angled arm shape, which serves as an element of various configurations. Here, we propose a method that leverages origami transformation, which typically reduces structural stiffness. We combined two...",

      "description": "Although eukaryotic initiation factor 2D (eIF2D) is implicated in translation initiation, reinitiation, and ribosome recycling, its precise role remains unclear. Here, we show that eIF2D promotes 40S ribosome recycling during intrinsic ribosome destabilization (IRD), a process in which ribosomes stochastically destabilize while translating proteins with consecutive acidic amino acids at their NH2-terminus. Unrecycled 40S ribosomes accumulate in eIF2D-deficient cells, leading to 80S ribosome...",
